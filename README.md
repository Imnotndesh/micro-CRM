# MICRO-CRM
A tiny CRM solution written in golang

## Why make this?
My plan was to try and learn containerization out of this while having something nice to preset as schoolwork for my final semester project

## Plans
- [x] Create the API
- [x] Publish container to GHCR
- [ ] Make Dashboard for it in React
- [ ] Write API documentation
- [ ] Add support for other DBs

## Future features for this if i get time
- [ ] Write a custom plugin system
- [ ] OIDC auth integration
